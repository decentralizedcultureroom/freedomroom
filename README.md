A freedom room is an empty room, devoid of inspiration, no screens, no books, no pictures, nothing.

It is an opportunity for participants to be confronted with an emptiness that encourages inward reflection and discovery of a source of inspiration within themselves.

Participants will be made aware that they can enter the room at their own free will, and are kindly requested to leave the room as they found it.
